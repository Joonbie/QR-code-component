## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Having still been new to html and css, This was a great start for the first challenge.
I learned how to position the card properly and to make the sizing of the card as similar to the design spec that was given.

I feel that the whole challenge process for me was a good learning project to break away from just watching tutorials and building something from scratch instead.

It was also the first time i had to work with the box-shadow tag in css.

```css
.primary-container {
  box-shadow: 0px 0px 10px 10px var(var(--bx-shadow));
}
```

### Useful resources

- [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) - This helped me for getting a clearer understanding of what the style tags that have been used.
- [Complete guide to centering in css](https://moderncss.dev/complete-guide-to-centering-in-css/) - This is an amazing article which helped me fully understand how to properly center a div using different ways. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
